This must have been done long time ago. VC should have went public years ago.

And a long journey has finally reached it's next stop: <a href="https://github.com/lakeofsoft/vcp">github.com/lakeofsoft/vcp</a>

Complete sources of VC components, including RTSP, conference and all the enterprise stuff is now public under Apache 2.0 licence.

It was an important part of my "Delphi" period, and I've learned a lot while developing it. Hope you can learn some tricks from it too.

Keep coding!
